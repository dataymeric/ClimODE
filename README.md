# ClimODE: Climate Forecasting With Physics-informed Neural ODEs

This repository is a reimplementation of the work [ClimODE](https://yogeshverma1998.github.io/ClimODE/) presented in the [ICLR 2024 Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xuY33XhEGR) by Yogesh Verma, Markus Heinonen, and Vikas Garg. The original paper explores the application of Physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for climate forecasting.

## Motivation

By reimagining the original PyTorch code within the PyTorch-Ignite framework, we aimed to enhance its scalability, readability, and adaptability. Leveraging distributed training capabilities and adhering to best practices in codebase organization, our goal was to facilitate efficient collaboration and maintain a clean, manageable codebase.

## Key Added Features

- **Framework Migration**: Transitioned the plain PyTorch codebase to the PyTorch-Ignite framework.
- **Distributed Training**: Enabled the use of distributed training for improved scalability.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Implemented coding standards, such as GitHub pre-commit hooks and EditorConfig, from the project's inception to ensure codebase consistency and readability.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Employed collaborative tools like GitHub pre-commit hooks and EditorConfig to foster effective collaboration and maintain codebase cleanliness.

### Summary of the Paper

The traditional approach to climate and weather prediction relies heavily on complex numerical simulations of atmospheric physics. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with models like transformers, have challenged this paradigm by offering complex network forecasts. However, these models often act as data-driven black boxes, neglecting underlying physics and lacking uncertainty quantification.

ClimODE addresses these limitations by introducing a spatiotemporal continuous-time process grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics, specifically the concept of advectionâ€”weather changes due to the spatial movement of quantities over time. By implementing value-conserving dynamics, ClimODE accurately models weather evolution while learning global weather transport as a neural flow. This approach enables effective uncertainty quantification in predictions.
